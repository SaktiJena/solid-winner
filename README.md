# gcp-sample-application
This application aims to use basic features of Google Cloud Platform(like Google Cloud Storage, Google Datastore etc.) through Java web Application.
## This application is deployed on Google App Engine. [Click here](https://spritehealth-gcp-application.appspot.com) to take a look.

## Aim:
- Create a simple JSP page with Upload functionality.
  - Upload an excel file with columns(FirstName, LastName, Username, Age, Password) for user registration table. 
  - Read the Excel file and create user records in Google Datastore. For each row in excel data sheet, 
  read the user registration data and create user records in a Datastore table, **Users**. 
  Any user with the credentials from excel, will be able to login the application.
  
  *I will keep adding various other functionalities of google-cloud-platform to this project.*
  ### Happy Coding !!
